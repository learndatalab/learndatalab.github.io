<!--We are a dynamic research group at the [Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University). Our aim is to develop Machine Learning and Data Mining models for Interconnected Data (e.g., human interactions, knowledge graphs, educational logs, multi-modal graphs, and multi-sensor data), as well as trustworthy and explainable AI for generative and graph-based models. We also focus on Natural Language Processing (e.g., knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs), knowledge editing for LLMs, watermarking for LLMs, and logical/symbolic reasoning). Our current research topics include self-supervised graph learning, multi-modal learning, question answering, knowledge tracing, and recommender systems.-->
<!--#### About Us  -->
We are a dynamic research group at [Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University). Our mission is to advance the fields of machine learning, data mining, trustworthy AI, and natural language processing through both theoretical and applied research.  

#### Research Areas  

##### 1. Machine Learning & Data Mining for Interconnected Data 
We develop models designed to handle complex, interconnected data sources such as human interactions, knowledge graphs, ontologies, educational logs, multi-modal graphs, and multi-sensor data.  

##### 2. Explainable and Trustworthy AI  
Our research emphasizes building AI systems that are both interpretable and reliable, with a focus on generative models and graph-based models.  

##### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
In NLP, we investigate methods for enhancing and responsibly learning large language models. Our work includes knowledge-enhanced LLMs, knowledge editing for LLMs, watermarking methods for LLMs, and logical as well as symbolic reasoning.
